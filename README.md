## Synopsis

Cooperative localization is still a challenging task for cooperative robot control. CoLo is a performance evaluation system for two-dimensional cooperative localization algorithms. The system consists of a physical experiment (CoLo-PE) for data collection and a software analysis tool (CoLo-AT) using real-world datasets to evaluate the performances of usersâ€™ cooperative localization algorithms. The goal of this project to let users to create and evaluate their own algorithms with some existing algorithms.

## Structure

There are two main parts in CoLo: a physical experiment (CoLo-PE) for data collection and a software analysis tool (CoLo-AT)
In CoLo-PE, it will shows the requriment hardwares and softwares needed for setting up the the physical experiments. 
In CoLo-AT, users can load their localization algorithms and test their performances using different datasets on various settings. 
Each parts can be used independetly for users' needs.
