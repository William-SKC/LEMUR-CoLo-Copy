# LEMUR CoLo

## Note
This is a copy of the [project] (https://uclalemur.com/research/colo-simulation-environment-for-cooperative-localization) I did at [UCLA LEMUR](https://uclalemur.com/).\
[GitLab](https://git.uclalemur.com/billyskc/CoLo). 

## Synopsis

Cooperative localization is still a challenging task for cooperative robot control. CoLo is a performance evaluation system for two-dimensional cooperative localization algorithms. The system consists of a physical experiment (CoLo-PE) for data collection and a software analysis tool (CoLo-AT) using real-world datasets to evaluate the performances of usersâ€™ cooperative localization algorithms. The goal of this project is to let users create and evaluate their own algorithms with some existing algorithms.

## Structure

There are two main parts in CoLo: a physical experiment (CoLo-PE) for data collection and a software analysis tool (CoLo-AT)
In CoLo-PE, it will show the required hardware and software needed for setting up the physical experiments. 
In CoLo-AT, users can load their localization algorithms and test their performances using different datasets in various settings. 
Each part can be used independently for users' needs.
